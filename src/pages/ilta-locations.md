          > As soon as I had my first lesson with Tamaz, I knew I would learn a
          lot from him. His knowledge and experience, his skill as a dancer and
          teacher left no doubt about it. As I continue to study with him, I
          realize that his patience and creativity as a teacher, his confidence
          in me, and the depth and breadth of his experience as a dancer are
          making me a better dancer than I ever dreamed possible. Tamaz is the
          best teacher I have ever had. He encourages me, and inspires me to
          continue to learn and improve as a dancer.

          > I have been a student of Tamaz’ now for over two years. I’ve danced
          for over 20 years with a variety of teachers and none has been as
          influential or as talented as Tamaz. Tamaz is an amazing dancer and
          also an innovative choreographer. He has taught me so much about dance
          and also about myself helping me gain the confidence to perform with a
          partner and to compete as well.

          >

          > Tamaz creates dance programs that are individually tailored and has
          a keen ability to assess just how much pushing or nurturing students
          need to challenge themselves and make them the best dancers they can
          be. Tamaz cares deeply for each one of his students and it is truly a
          pleasure taking lessons from him. He has my highest recommendation and
          I personally look forward to many more years of learning from someone
          who I believe to be one of the best in the business.

          > ILTA Dance Studio is a truly rare find. The owners are not only
          remarkable pro dancers, but they also possess a unique ability to
          teach both children and adults the art of dancing. They are committed
          and passionate teachers and also fun loving, amicable people.I never
          imagined my husband on the dance floor, now, thanks to the skillful
          work of ILTA, he searches the web for places to CHA CHA! Boston night
          life has a whole new meaning.

          > If you are looking for a great ballroom dance studio, look no
          further. ILTA Dance Studio is a fabulous find! First impressions are
          lasting impressions as the saying goes and I knew immediately that
          ILTA Dance Studio would be a great place for me. From my first
          conversations with Ilana and Tamaz I was impressed with their warmth
          and genuine interest in my needs while articulating clearly what ILTA
          had to offer.
