          Your first dance together as husband and wife is an expression of your
          love and commitment, embodying the vows youâ€™ve just made to one
          another. Make your special dance elegant and memorable. Amaze your
          family and friends.


          Wedding dance preparation includes basic instruction in dance
          fundamentals leading to a choreography developed just for the two of
          you (to a song of your choice) and the skill to gracefully improvise
          on the dance floor.
